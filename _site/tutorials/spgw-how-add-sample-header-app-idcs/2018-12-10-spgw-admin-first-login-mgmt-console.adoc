The first time you log in to the SPGateway Management Console, we recommend that you change the password for the _spgw-mgmt_ user.

NOTE: In order to access the Management Console, you must have physical access to the SPGateway environment. You cannot SSH into the SPGateway Management Console.

== Log in to the SPGateway machine

. From the SPGateway machine, open the terminal or console and use the credentials provided by your ICSynergy Engineer to log in with the _spgw-mgmt_ user.
. After you log in, the main *SPGateway Administration* menu appears. Select the option *6 - Change Password* to change the default password.

TIP: Refer to https://docs.icsynergy.com/administration/spgw-admin-password-policies.html[SPGateway Password Policies] for information about password requirements and security.
