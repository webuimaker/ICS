Todayâ€™s enterprises are quickly adopting cloud-based solutions for business applications and Identity as a Service (IDaaS), such as Okta and Oracle IDCS, for single sign-on (SSO) and more. While remarkably convenient, a cloud-based architecture creates its own architectural and integration challenges that have typically been solved by an on-premise web access management (WAM) solution.

Building on decades of experience architecting, implementing, and consulting on Identity and Access Management solutions, ICSynergy has created the SPGateway to help business solve modern application integration challenges. The SPGateway is the easiest and most secure solution for seamlessly integrating your WAM applications with an IDaaS platform.

The SPGateway is an ideal solution for any IDaaS customer with any of the following use cases:

* Your enterprise wants to unify all IAM under an IDaaS platform, but requires integration with applications that do not support federation (SAML, WS-Fed).
* Vendors, customers, or partners must access your internal business applications (like SharePoint, Oracle E-Business Suite, etc.) from the internet.
* Your company wants to restrict unauthorized network access to your applications.
* Your company wants to comply with industry regulations, like Sarbanes-Oxley, HIPPA, and others.
* Your enterprise has web applications that lack a native authentication mechanism.
* Your company is looking for a cost-effective replacement for your on-premise WAM solution.
* Your company requires a supported replacement of Shibboleth.

Installing the SPGateway on your own hosted solution, or on a cloud-based computing platform (like AWS or Azure), is a simple process. The SPGateway is a high-performance appliance that is installed within your hosting solution of choice and leverages your DNS and networking solutions to provide services. As the SPGateway leverages your existing solutions, there are specific tasks that must be completed as part of the installation.

The Getting Started section is intended to provide you with the information you need to fully understand the installation prerequisites and ensure a seamless installation of SPGateway.
