When creating a support ticket, it is recommended that you allow a support connection to the SPGateway appliance in question. This allows an ICSynergy Support agent to log in to the appliance and inspect the logs and configuration as part of the troubleshooting process.

IMPORTANT: When the support connection is enabled, the SPGateway appliance establishes a connection with the Support channel. You must ensure that the firewall does not block the connection to the Support channel as this will prevent the ICSynergy Support agent from connecting to the appliance and beginning the troubleshooting process.

For reference, the firewall must allow the connection to: *Host*: `spgwvpn.icsynergy.in` *IP Address*: `54.148.241.195` *Port*: `443`
