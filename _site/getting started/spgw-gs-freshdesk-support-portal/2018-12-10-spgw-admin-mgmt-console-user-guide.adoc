//Michael/Courtney: ignore these first two comments from me...they're more just reminders for myself.
//some of the links have purposely been commented out because they need to be updated once we backport the corresponding documentation to wordpress. I'll come back to this and update it.
//We should also be linking to the relative asciidoc files instead of only linking to the support site URLs. Eventually we will move to a static site, so reducing our future workload is something we need to consider. If we add relative file links here (like we did in the OEM files), we should be able to 1) generate the HTML and 2) find/replace the base URL with the correct support.icsynergy.com base URL. Should be easy? -JA

== Introduction

The purpose of this guide is to list the options available within the *spgw-mgmt* user account for configuring and monitoring the SPGateway Management Console.

== First Login

. Start the SPGateway VM and open a terminal window. Default credentials are given below:
** *Username*: spgw-mgmt
** *Password*: ICSynergy@123
+
NOTE: In order to access the Management Console, you must have physical access to the SPGateway environment. You cannot SSH into the SPGateway Management Console.

==== SPGateway Admin
//This section has a couple issues. 1) I think the images are one off, meaning the image for one of the menu items is actually displayed on the next menu item instead. Should be an easy fix. 2) Why aren't we describing what these menus do? Telling a user how to get into the menu is pointless if we don't also describe what the commands do. We need to expand on these. Michael/Courtney, is this something you feel comfortable tackling (expanding the command descriptions)? My hunch is that you can copy from the other spgw-over-management-console.adoc file for additional info. -JA
