= SPGateway Admin UI Console
:page-layout: post
:page-category: Overview

== Introduction

The SPGateway Admin UI Console provides several options and settings to SPGateway administrators. Using the Admin Console, you can add new Identity Providers, add application integrations, manage settings, and engage with Support. As an SPGateway administrator, this is where most of the day-to-day management takes place.

There are five tabs available in the Admin Console at all times, listed below in the Contents section.

* Topology
* Applications
* Sites
* Settings
* Support

== Topology

The *Topology* tab displays the Identity Provider(s) (IdP) that is connected to the SPGateway instance and the application(s) that are currently configured in the environment. Here is an example of a topology map:

[NOTE]
====

* Click an application on the topology map to edit the application settings.
* Click the IdP icon to go to the IdP portal homepage.
====

== Applications

The *Applications* tab lists all of the applications currently configured in the SPGateway, and also provides these additional options:

//I removed the list that was here along with the large screenshot with circles that indicate the different buttons/icons. The large screenshot was not clear because it does not distinguish which callout matches to which button/icon. I added in the old icon/button descriptions from the original topic along with the new text you wrote.

//Need to add a small image to show the add button
*+ Add*: Use this to add an application to the SPGateway environment.

//There needs to be some text for each of these tabs, and I'm not crazy about including big screenshots of each one. I'd like to use an include:: to grab the corresponding settings/attributes/policies topics once they're converted to SPGateway.

== SPGateway Settings
//Michael / Courtney: Please reorganize this section so that there is a header for each of the four side tabs in the Settings area. The four sections will be SPGateway, Identity Providers, Kerberos, and Auth Modules. A lot of the information is already here, but it was originally written/organized in a confusing order. If you need any help expanding on the content, just let me know. /jla 7-18-2018

The *SPGateway Settings* tab allows you to configure several settings in the SPGateway. The configurable settings are divided into four categories, each of which appears as a tab on the left-hand side of the Admin UI Console.

These four tabs are *SPGateway*, *Identity Providers*, *Kerberos*, and *Auth Modules*.

=== SPGateway
Under the *SPGateway* tab, you can:

* Validate the status of your SPGateway Cookie domain and SPGateway Hostname.

+

* Synchronize system time with the NTP server
* Rerun the SPGateway Setup via the setup wizard. (This option takes you through the initial setup process that allows you to change the hostname, cookie domain, and IdP settings.)
