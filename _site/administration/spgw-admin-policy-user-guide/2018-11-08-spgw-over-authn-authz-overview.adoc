For reference, see the https://docs.icsynergy.com/overview/spgw-over-functional-component-overview.html[Functional Components Overview] chart for a complete picture of how the SPGateway components operate together.

== Authentication Component

The SPGateway Authentication component contains the SAML functionality, identity provider capabilities, handshake logic, and more.

=== SAML Service Provider
SPGateway supports user flows that originate from an Identity Provider by acting as a service provider via SAML protocol. This funtionality enables applications that lack SAML components to authenticate with IDaaS solutions without custom development.

=== Identity Provider
SPGateway also provides identity provider capabilities through client certificate authentication. Additionally, alternate authentication methods are available.

=== Handshake and Authorization Session
* Temp auth cookie
* Populate session attributes
* SAML attributes
* Static values
* External data source lookups

== Authorization Component
The Authorization component handles sessions and policies for the SPGateway appliance.

=== Handshake from Authentication
Once a user is authenticated, SPGateway can upgrade an authorization cookie to a session cookie.

=== Sessions
* Per application
* Idle, max
* Finger printing
* Session cookie

=== Policy
* Authorized users
* Unauthorized users
* Rule-based
* Certificates
