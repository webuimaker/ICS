=== Determine the IP address and modify the host file

To configure the SPGateway instance, you must add a line to the host file on all machines that need access to this SPGateway instance.

. Log in to the SPGateway server using these credentials:
.. *Username*: spgw-mgmt
.. *Password*: ICSynergy@123
+
IMPORTANT: We recommend you change the password after logging in.
+
. Once you are logged in, the system will provide you with several menu options.
. Enter *1* to enter the *Network* menu.

. The *eth0* section on the next page shows the IP address of the server. Make note of this IP address, as it will be used later in this guide.

. Keep pressing Enter until you are back to the *Network* menu.
. Press *X* to exit the Network menu, and press *X* again to exit the UI.
. Add a line to the host file on the machine running the VM as shown in the example below. Use the IP address you collected above.
