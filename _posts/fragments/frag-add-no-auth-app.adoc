[NOTE]
====
* Make sure that the public domain defined in step 1 of the *Configure the No-Auth Application Settings* section in  http://support.icsynergy.com/knowledge-base/add-a-no-auth-application-to-spgateway/#configure-the-no-auth-application-settings[Add a No-Auth Application to SPGateway] is added to the local hosts file pointing to the machine that hosts SPGateway. For instance, the application in this example has been created using the public domain: `header.icsynergy.info`. In order to access this, you must add `xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx noauth.icsynergy.info` to the local hosts file where `xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx` is the IP address of the machine that hosts SPGateway.
* When testing, note that the address bar changes the Wikipedia URL to the Public Domain URL (in this example, https://noauth-icsynergy.info).
