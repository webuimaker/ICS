== Introduction

The purpose of this guide is to walk through the process of setting up the SPGateway Admin Console.


== Set Up SPGateway

. Add a new entry labeled *admin* to the *DNS Server* that will access this SPGateway instance.
+
----
<ipaddress of box> admin
----
+
NOTE: This admin DNS entry is required for SPGateway Service Access and should NOT be deleted.
+
. Navigate to https://admin/[https://admin/] page to access SPGateway.
+

//Note below can be replaced with frag-self-signed-certificate-production-vs-non.adoc. CMC 11/28
+
NOTE: SPGateway creates a default self-signed certificate. For non-production deployments, this will be appropriate. Proceed past any security exceptions raised by your browser. For production deployments, a valid certificate can be installed and these exceptions will not be needed.
