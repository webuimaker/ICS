== Introduction
IdentityRM is a platform that facilitates digital business transformation. IdentityRM provides an evolved thought process where identities belong to relationships, and relationships become the fundamental managed entity.

Relationships allow you to provide business context and macro layer for managing identity within digital business models.

The IdentityRM portal supplies a platform agnostic interface for end-users and administrators who are not tied to any particular SSO or Identity technology. The portal is built upon the latest web technologies such as Bootstrap 3.0 that is fully responsive and mobile aware.

This guide describes how to use IdentityRM as an administrator and end user.

=== Benefits
* *SSO Service:* Integrated with industry leading SSO platforms to allow policy-based access single sign-on to SAAS applications such as SalesForce, Office 365 and more.
* *Application Request:* Configurable workflows to allow users to request and seek approval for access to applications.
* *User Management:* Administration of users by delegated administrators as well as self-service User registration, profile management, and password recovery.
* *Cloud hosted:* Deployed in docker containers that can be hosted at AWS, Azure, on-premise or any environment that supports docker containers.

=== Accessing IdentityRM
To access IdentityRM, you need to install and then use according to your user persona.

==== Install IdentityRM
To install IdentityRM, refer to the *IdentityRM Installation Guide*.

*Role Required:* Administrator

==== Log in and access using Designated Persona

To begin using IdentityRM, refer to the  *IdentityRM Installation Guide*.

*Role Required:* Administrator

*Switching Persona*
With the same login, you can use multiple personas to access IdentityRM. A user persona defines the type of role a user plays in an organization. For example, administrator, end user, network engineer.

*Role Required:* Administrator or End User

After installation, use your credentials to login and select one of the designated personas. With the same login, you can use multiple personas to access IdentityRM. The access of features in application varies according to the selected persona  For example, select administrator or end user.


=== Multiple User personas
An organization has different set of users with separate roles assigned. Users with different set of access rights are categorized as a specific user persona. For example, Administrator and Operation User are two different user personas of the same organization.

IdentityRM lets organization manage multiple user personas in a simple way. Organizations decide user personas and IdentityRM makes sure to provide only the assigned access to a user persona while working on the same user interface of the product.

==== Example Scenario
Let us consider an example. IdentityRM has multiple functions. Some of those are, allowing access to entitlements, creating business models, adding relationship model, managing nodes, creating and managing campaign, managing users, and so on.

An administrator can get access to all the features, while an operational user needs access only to manage own profile and request access to entitlements.

IdentityRM support ensures that multiple user personas use the same user interface to perform respetive tasks at the same time. For example, the operation user can request access for entitlements and administration can review and approve the requests.

==== Using Multiple User Personas
An organization can have multiple tenants and all tenants also have multiple user personas. Whether you have an organization, business unit, franchise or dealership, at all levels you can define multiple user personas when using IdentityRM.

Org A needs Org B administrators to be able to assign access to Org B applications to Org A users. Org A uses the delegated organization feature to delegate user management to the administrator of Org B. The Org B administrator cannot manage the Org A user in any other way (For example, Reset password)


=== Key Terms
